Hi there, thanks for taking a look at my coding challenge project!

This project uses React and JavaScript, and all you'll need to do is:
cd into the folder 'frontend' from your terminal
run 'npm install'
and then run 'npm start' to view it in your browser

the default port should be 3000 if it doesn't automatically open in your browser.
